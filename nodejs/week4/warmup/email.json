I can see Dari's point.  Since I will be out of town 12/11-12/12 when final allocated volumes come out, Vernon will work with Gas Logistics to do a Split Path manual, if necessary, to override the max overrun (OVA) rate with the firm rate.  When I get back, I will create tariff exception(s) reflecting the manuals to keep our records straight.  The MID-to-MID level tiered overrun discount will require manual review each month.  If shipper flows more than 5% overrun overall on any day, discounts may have to be entered at the path level to prevent discounting more overrun than the deal permits.\n\nAffects 2 contracts: 108437 & 108489.  Tiered OVA discounts are currently entered on from several field MIDs to MID 16A, providing a discount on the first 1750/day on 108437 and 3675/day for 108489.\nIn practice, TAS will discount the first 1750 or 3675/day on each individual path.  If 108489 flows 3000 overrun on each of 2 different MID 1- to MID 16A paths in a day, TAS will apply the discount to a total overrun volume of 6000.\n\nAnother Question:  Vernon - Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to 5% of the contract MDQ on a daily basis, or on a monthly basis?  For example, on 108489, MDQ=73,500 so 5%=3675.  Is it your intention to discount only up to 3675 overrun each day, or would you discount up to 3675*30=110,250 Overrun for the month, regardless of daily flow levels?\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMercaldo, Vernon  \nSent:\tThursday, December 06, 2001 11:55 AM\nTo:\tDornan, Dari; Bianchi, Rita; Blair, Lynn; Kirk, Steve\nCc:\tKowalke, Terry; Buchanan, John; Berger, Larry; Janzen, Randy; Linhart, Joe; Williams, Jo; Joyce, Jane\nSubject:\tRE: OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues\n\nRita,\n\nNot to complicate things, but, they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to 5% of the MDQ at the contract rate (demand + commodity).

I can see Dari's point.  Since I will be out of town 12/11-12/12 when final allocated volumes come out, Vernon will work with Gas Logistics to do a Split Path manual, if necessary, to override the max overrun (OVA) rate with the firm rate.  When I get back, I will create tariff exception(s) reflecting the manuals to keep our records straight.  The MID-to-MID level tiered overrun discount will require manual review each month.  If shipper flows more than 5% overrun overall on any day, discounts may have to be entered at the path level to prevent discounting more overrun than the deal permits.\n\nAffects 2 contracts: 108437 & 108489.  Tiered OVA discounts are currently entered on from several field MIDs to MID 16A, providing a discount on the first 1750/day on 108437 and 3675/day for 108489.\nIn practice, TAS will discount the first 1750 or 3675/day on each individual path.  If 108489 flows 3000 overrun on each of 2 different MID 1- to MID 16A paths in a day, TAS will apply the discount to a total overrun volume of 6000.\n\nAnother Question:  Vernon - Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to 5% of the contract MDQ on a daily basis, or on a monthly basis?  For example, on 108489, MDQ=73,500 so 5%=3675.  Is it your intention to discount only up to 3675 overrun each day, or would you discount up to 3675*30=110,250 Overrun for the month, regardless of daily flow levels?\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMercaldo, Vernon  \nSent:\tThursday, December 06, 2001 11:55 AM\nTo:\tDornan, Dari; Bianchi, Rita; Blair, Lynn; Kirk, Steve\nCc:\tKowalke, Terry; Buchanan, John; Berger, Larry; Janzen, Randy; Linhart, Joe; Williams, Jo; Joyce, Jane\nSubject:\tRE: OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues\n\nRita,\n\nNot to complicate things, but, they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to 5% of the MDQ at the contract rate (demand + commodity).

Provide status of November chart information.\n\n\tGas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time\n\tframe for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.\n\tAs you \tfind there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. \n\tThis way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.\n\n\tWe appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused\n\tto get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let\n\tRick or I know.  Thanks.

Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.  Below is my update on a few GISB matters.  We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.\n\nENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB)\nThe GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.  The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).  The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.

Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003.\nMy term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.\n\nORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING\nThe development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.\n\nGISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA\nTwo separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.\n\n\nThanks,\nTheresa","content":"\nDue to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year.

In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.\n\nGISB REPRESENTATON\nStan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.  Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003.\nMy term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.\n\nORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING\nThe development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.\n\nGISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA\nTwo separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.\n\n\nThanks,\nTheresa","messageId":"<1556399.1075859377898.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-12-15T00:59:46+01:00","from":"theresa.hess@enron.com","subject":"GISB Update","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Hess, Theresa </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=THESS>","xTo":"Berger, Larry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lberger>, Betancourt, Ramona  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RBETANC>, Bianchi, Rita </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RBIANCHI>, Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>, Buchanan, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jbuchan2>, Cappiello, Deborah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dcappie>, Carrillo, Alma </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ACARRIL>, Coburn, Scott </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Scoburn>, Corman, Shelley </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Scorman>, Darveaux, Mary </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MDARVEA>, Draemer, Mary  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MDRAEME>, Garcia, Ava </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Agarcia6>, Harrill, Billi </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bharril>, Hartsoe, Joe </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhartso>, Hayslett, Rod </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rhaysle>, Hess, Theresa </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Thess>, Holmes, Bradley </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bholmes>, Kirk, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Skirk>, Kowalke, Terry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tkowalk>, Kuehl, Toby </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TKUEHL>, Lichtenwalter, Blair </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Blichte>, Lindley, Hilda </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hlindle>, Lohman, TK </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tlohman>, Lokey, Teb </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tlokey>, Matheson, Maggie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MMATHES>, Medeles, Gerry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=GMEDELE>, Nacey, Sheila </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Snacey>, Neubauer, Dave </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dneubau>, Puetz, Fred </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fpuetz>, Sawyer, Lisa </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lsawyer>, Scott, Donna </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dscott1>, Studebaker, James  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JSTUDEB>, Willemyns, Laurie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lwillem>, Winckowski, Michele </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mwincko>, Winters, Ricki </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RWINTER>, Zadow, Raetta </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rzadow>","xFolder":"\\Lynn_Blair_Jan2002\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"lblair (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"larry.berger@enron.com,ramona.betancourt@enron.com,rita.bianchi@enron.com,lynn.blair@enron.com,john.buchanan@enron.com,deborah.cappiello@enron.com,alma.carrillo@enron.com,scott.coburn@enron.com,shelley.corman@enron.com,mary.darveaux@enron.com,mary.draemer@enron.com,ava.garcia@enron.com,billi.harrill@enron.com,joe.hartsoe@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,theresa.hess@enron.com,bradley.holmes@enron.com,steve.kirk@enron.com,terry.kowalke@enron.com,toby.kuehl@enron.com,blair.lichtenwalter@enron.com,hilda.lindley@enron.com,tk.lohman@enron.com,teb.lokey@enron.com,maggie.matheson@enron.com,gerry.medeles@enron.com,sheila.nacey@enron.com,dave.neubauer@enron.com,fred.puetz@enron.com,lisa.sawyer@enron.com,donna.scott@enron.com,james.studebaker@enron.com,laurie.willemyns@enron.com,michele.winckowski@enron.com,ricki.winters@enron.com,raetta.zadow@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\nPlease see Shelley's e-mail address below!!!!\n \nThank you, Ricki\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Corman, Shelley \nSent: Sunday, December 16, 2001 11:32 PM\nTo: McFarland, Jean\nCc: Winters, Ricki\nSubject: RE: email\n\n\nJean,\n \nI am in Almaty.

Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as needed to help you in\n\tthis effort.\n\n\tAll clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001.","messageId":"<19038928.1075853080155.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-03T22:51:07+02:00","from":"lynn.blair@enron.com","subject":"Outstanding A/R Issues Back to January, 1998","cc":"alice.johnson@enron.com, rick.dietz@enron.com, lynn.blair@enron.com","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","bcc":"alice.johnson@enron.com, rick.dietz@enron.com, lynn.blair@enron.com","xFrom":"Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=LBLAIR>","xTo":"Berger, Larry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lberger>, Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>, Bodnar, Michael </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mbodnar>, Buchanan, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jbuchan2>, Kowalke, Terry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tkowalk>, Zadow, Raetta </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rzadow>, Adams, Jean </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jadams1>, Benningfield, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbennin>, Forbish, Sherry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sforbis>, Greaney, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cgreane>, Hibbard, Scott </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Shibbard>, Janzen, Randy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rjanzen>, Linhart, Joe </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jlinhar>, McDaniel, Janet </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmcdani>, Scurlock, Debra </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dscurloc>, Sturr, Kathy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ksturr>, Vaughan, Cara </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cvaughan>, Woodson, Harry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hwoodso>, Barry, Patrick </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pbarry>, Blair, Jean </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jblair>, Bryan, Randy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbryan2>, Callans, Nancy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ncallan>, Carr, James </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jcarr2>, Clapper, Karen </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kclappe>, Perry, Renee </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kperry>, Porter, Diana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dporter1>, Walden, Shirley </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Swalden>, Washington, Kathy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kwashin>, Wilkens, Jerry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jwilken>","xCc":"Johnson, Alice </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ajohnso>, Dietz, Rick </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rdietz>, Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"larry.berger@enron.com,lynn.blair@enron.com,michael.bodnar@enron.com,john.buchanan@enron.com,terry.kowalke@enron.com,raetta.zadow@enron.com,jean.adams@enron.com,robert.benningfield@enron.com,sherry.forbish@enron.com,chris.greaney@enron.com,scott.hibbard@enron.com,randy.janzen@enron.com,joe.linhart@enron.com,janet.mcdaniel@enron.com,debra.scurlock@enron.com,kathy.sturr@enron.com,cara.vaughan@enron.com,harry.woodson@enron.com,patrick.barry@enron.com,jean.blair@enron.com,randy.bryan@enron.com,nancy.callans@enron.com,james.carr@enron.com,karen.clapper@enron.com,renee.perry@enron.com,diana.porter@enron.com,shirley.walden@enron.com,kathy.washington@enron.com,jerry.wilkens@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\nBelow is an Excel spreadsheet that shows all outstanding November 2001 TW transportation invoices mailed to ENA on 12/03/01 in which they were designated as the payor.

They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.\n\nI don't know the outcome of their conversation.\n\nI thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?\n\nCall me if you have questions.\n\nJean\n3-7757\n","content":"\nNo, I do not want the ENA contract hit with these flows.

All Rights Reserved. \t\n\n\n\nEnron's Bonds Tell the Tale: Stay Away\nBy Herb Greenberg <<mailto:hgreenberg@thestreet.com>>\nSenior Columnist\nRealMoney.com\n10/24/2001 03:40 PM EDT\nURL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/herbonthestreet-rm/10002953.html>>\n\nUpdated from 2:47 p.m. EDT \nIf you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap, check out its bonds. Bond analysts almost always know best because they're looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can't service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid. \nWhich brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, \"accounting irregularities = sell.\" \nGood point. Now let's back that up with the bond market's view, which can be seen in the so-called \"swap spread,\" which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It's a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron's five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it's 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing. \nWhy? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion. \nAnd this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That's a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that's still not enough \"where the accounting is questionable,\" one bond trader says. \"You're not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value.\" \nNot the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B. \nSpeaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents. \nWhere are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They're nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they're not jumping to buy Enron's bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to \"hope-springs-eternal\" stock investors!) \nProvidian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn't find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody'll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence. \n\n\nWaiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on Enron\nBy James J. Cramer <<mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com>>\n\nRealMoney.com\n10/24/2001 10:33 AM EDT\nURL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10002911.html>>\n\nAccounting irregularities = sell. Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn't sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . \nWhich is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can't see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn? \nAll I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud. \nWhen that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny. \nBut I bet I still won't like it. \n\n\nEnron's Excuses Sound Familiar\nBy James J. Cramer <<mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com>>\n\nRealMoney.com\n10/23/2001 01:43 PM EDT\nURL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10002874.html>>\nIf you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? \nThat's what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! \nWhat they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery.

No investor should be buying -- or holding -- stock in companies if they don't read their filings carefully. It's hard enough to discern what's going on in a business without doing so, and even in those filings -- such as with options grants to management -- the real meat is buried in footnotes. Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only.\nWhat Enron's failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it'll be darned if it'll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management's spin. In Enron's case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron's earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion.\nIs management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes <<http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151>>:\n\"On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company's previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn't normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won't have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet.\"\nThat's a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse. \nGood corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today's income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what's the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more.\nTom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) would like to improve his own cash flow statement. At press time, he owned no shares of Enron.

Barr\n\n10/24/2001\nCapital Markets Report\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nOf DOWJONES NEWSWIRES \n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader.\nThe bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, \"started trading with a dollar price two days ago,\" said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C. \nBonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80's to low 90's, say traders. \nInvestment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. \"Credit bonds,\" which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst. \nMoody's Investors Service rates the company's senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus. \nBut the company \"may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, \" said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. \n\"I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds,\" Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can't have paper below investment-grade. \nHouston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. \nEnron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry. \nThe company's stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share. \nAnd, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is \"not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don't know.\" \n\n-By Michael C. Barr, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2008; michael.barr@dowjones.com \n(David Feldheim contributed to this article.)\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. \nPlanned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. \nOnly directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. \nMinow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. \nTheir latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. \n\"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. \nThe corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. \nOne example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Minow said. \n\"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here.\" \nTaking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. \n\"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said. \nInstitutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. \n\"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,\" said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. \nSurveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. \"More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,\" Gleason said.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bond analysts almost always know best because they're looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can't service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid. \nWhich brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, \"accounting irregularities = sell.\" \nGood point. Now let's back that up with the bond market's view, which can be seen in the so-called \"swap spread,\" which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It's a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron's five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it's 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing. \nWhy? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion. \nAnd this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That's a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that's still not enough \"where the accounting is questionable,\" one bond trader says. \"You're not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value.\" \nNot the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B. \nSpeaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents. \nWhere are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They're nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they're not jumping to buy Enron's bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to \"hope-springs-eternal\" stock investors!) \nProvidian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn't find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody'll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence. \n\n\nWaiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on Enron\nBy James J. Cramer <<mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com>>\n\nRealMoney.com\n10/24/2001 10:33 AM EDT\nURL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10002911.html>>\n\nAccounting irregularities = sell. Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn't sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . \nWhich is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can't see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn? \nAll I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud. \nWhen that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny. \nBut I bet I still won't like it. \n\n\nEnron's Excuses Sound Familiar\nBy James J. Cramer <<mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com>>\n\nRealMoney.com\n10/23/2001 01:43 PM EDT\nURL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10002874.html>>\nIf you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? \nThat's what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! \nWhat they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. \nNope. \nWhat it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. \nEnron didn't use taxpayers' money, so it is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. \nWe don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. \nIn the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole.

Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only.\nWhat Enron's failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it'll be darned if it'll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management's spin. In Enron's case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron's earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion.\nIs management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes <<http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151>>:\n\"On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company's previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn't normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won't have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet.\"\nThat's a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse. \nGood corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today's income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what's the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more.\nTom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) would like to improve his own cash flow statement. At press time, he owned no shares of Enron.

Barr\n\n10/24/2001\nCapital Markets Report\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nOf DOWJONES NEWSWIRES \n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader.\nThe bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, \"started trading with a dollar price two days ago,\" said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C. \nBonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80's to low 90's, say traders. \nInvestment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. \"Credit bonds,\" which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst. \nMoody's Investors Service rates the company's senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus. \nBut the company \"may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, \" said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. \n\"I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds,\" Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can't have paper below investment-grade. \nHouston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. \nEnron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry. \nThe company's stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share. \nAnd, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is \"not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don't know.\" \n\n-By Michael C. Barr, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2008; michael.barr@dowjones.com \n(David Feldheim contributed to this article.)\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nUSA: Group to put corporate directors under microscope.\nBy Kevin Drawbaugh\n\n10/24/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\nWASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's cofounder said on Wednesday. \nIn a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.\n\"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. \nPlanned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. \nOnly directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. \nMinow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. \nTheir latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. \n\"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. \nThe corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. \nOne example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Minow said. \n\"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here.\" \nTaking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. \n\"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said. \nInstitutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. \n\"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,\" said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. \nSurveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. \"More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,\" Gleason said.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In the near future, we will be conducting a drill of these procedures, so don't be surprised if someone from our management team comes into Gas Control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice. \n\nThanks in advance for your co-operation, and thank you for the great job everyone is doing.","messageId":"<1090098.1075861907965.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-11-07T15:52:55+01:00","from":"shelley.corman@enron.com","subject":"Fire Drills and Emergency Response","cc":"nick.rahn@enron.com, gary.kenagy@enron.com, rick.dietz@enron.com, ","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","bcc":"nick.rahn@enron.com, gary.kenagy@enron.com, rick.dietz@enron.com, ","xFrom":"Corman, Shelley </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SCORMAN>","xTo":"Angeletti, Donald </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dangele>, Bell, Bill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bbell>, Bellard, Dannis </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dbellar>, Bryant, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mbryant>, Chambers, Steven </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Schamb2>, Dobrinski, Jodi </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jdobrin>, Hebert, Thomas </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Thebert>, Reid, Byron </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Breid>, Velen, David </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dvelen>, Winters, Ricki </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rwinter>, Alvarado, Jesse </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jalvara>, Armitage, Roy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rarmita>, Barnes, Rodney </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbarnes>, Barry, Richard </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbarry>, Braswell, Keith </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kbraswe>, Brown, Sharon </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrown1>, Calhoun, Rory </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rcalhou>, Coash, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Scoash>, Cochran, Jeffrey </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jcochra>, Cummings, Helen </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hcummin>, Ellington, Michael </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Melling>, Graves, Jerry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jgraves>, Hall, Margaret </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mhall1>, Hardy, Crandal </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Chardy2>, Henley, Gaynel </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ghenley>, Heredia, Melissa </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=ec8ab5a2-36e669e2-862568be-4b35fa>, January, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sjanuary>, Monden, Bart </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmonden>, Moore, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmoore7>, Munson, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rmunson>, Muntz, Alan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Amuntz>, Ratliff, Dale </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dratlif>, Schoolcraft, Darrell </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dschool>, Shafer, Allen </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=cbe9c022-ca8fb1a6-86256727-582a54>, Spain, Ron </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rspain>, Welsh, Edward </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ewelsh>","xCc":"Rahn, Nick </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Nrahn>, Kenagy, Gary </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gkenagy>, Dietz, Rick </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rdietz>, Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"donald.angeletti@enron.com,bill.bell@enron.com,dannis.bellard@enron.com,mike.bryant@enron.com,steven.chambers@enron.com,jodi.dobrinski@enron.com,thomas.hebert@enron.com,byron.reid@enron.com,david.velen@enron.com,ricki.winters@enron.com,jesse.alvarado@enron.com,roy.armitage@enron.com,rodney.barnes@enron.com,richard.barry@enron.com,keith.braswell@enron.com,sharon.brown@enron.com,rory.calhoun@enron.com,steve.coash@enron.com,jeffrey.cochran@enron.com,helen.cummings@enron.com,michael.ellington@enron.com,jerry.graves@enron.com,margaret.hall@enron.com,crandal.hardy@enron.com,gaynel.henley@enron.com,melissa.heredia@enron.com,steve.january@enron.com,bart.monden@enron.com,jeff.moore@enron.com,robert.munson@enron.com,alan.muntz@enron.com,dale.ratliff@enron.com,darrell.schoolcraft@enron.com,allen.shafer@enron.com,ron.spain@enron.com,edward.welsh@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\n\t\n\tEffective November 1, 2001, Northern implemented new posting procedures regarding capacity availability.

Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some\n\tof yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we\n\twould at least  throw them on the table.\n\n\t1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement\n\t     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be\n\t     required in the \"Bushton Universe\", just not as restrictive as it is today.\n\n\t2.

I think you are correct that a long term solution will require acceptance of procedural changes by Oneok.  I think the Richfield storage idea should be looked at.  To my knowledge, there isn't any storage activity at this field but maybe there could be.  \n\nIn the mean time, I am going to propose that we put an OBA in place for the new customer I am trying to satisfy right now.  The OBA can be revoked on 48 hours notice if we can come up with a better idea.  I have strung this guy along as long as I can.

These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we\n\twould at least  throw them on the table.\n\n\t1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement\n\t     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.

attached is a result of a phone call that I made to Rita to find out where we may have talked about daily measurement in the tariff just in case we need to explain this further to the Measurement Group.\n\nThanks,\n\nRaetta\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBianchi, Rita  \nSent:\tMonday, November 12, 2001 10:11 AM\nTo:\tZadow, Raetta\nSubject:\tDaily Measurement\n\n\nI looked at the tariff and talked to Mary Darveaux.  NNG must have true daily measured volumes, as opposed to a monthly measurement divided by days in the month, for several business reasons.\n\nReferences to daily volumes and calculations are sprinkled throughout the tariff.\n1.  For example, under the TF & TFX Rate Schedules, the tariff states that the MDQ (maximum daily quantity) is the firm service that NNG is obligated to provide on a daily basis.  We can't provide a daily service if we do not have daily measurements.\n2.  Curtailment provisions in the tariff require DAILY measurement.\n3.  DDVCs require accurate DAILY measurement.  DDVCs are a part of NNG's revenue.  Even if NNG were to bill on scheduled volumes at the beginning of the month, true-up to actuals would be required.  DDVCs would not disappear, they would simply move from the commodity billing to imbalance billing after measurement close.  Order 637 may change some aspects of DDVCs but it will not eliminate them or change the daily nature of the abuses DDVCs are designed to discourage.\n\nFurthermore - \n1.  That's the way the gas transportation industry operates.  It may not be a GISB standard, but it is a fact of life.  \n2.  Most contracts executed through EOL are for 1-2 days of service at a time.  Gas flowing at a point could vary significantly during the month and a point may be used by different parties at different times.  We can't just assume that the same amount flowed every day for everyone.\n3.  Overrun charges are based on gas flows above the contract MDQ (Maximum DAILY Quantity) each day of the month.  Using an artificial, average daily measurement would mask overrun volumes (and reduce NNG revenue, since Overrun pays a higher rate than firm commodity).  A shipper could avoid paying overrun if it flowed below MDQ on some days and above on others.\n4.  We have several contracts with volumetric provisions which cannot be accurately billed without DAILY measurements.  An example would be Utilicorp and all of its Taconite contracts.\n5.  NNG is looking at moving to daily dollar-valued OBAs.  If NNG can't tell what is flowing on a daily basis, customers can game the system by pushing extra gas into the pipe on days when the price is lower and withdrawing it on other days when the price is slightly higher.  Gas prices can fluctuate considerably during the month.  Multiplied times a bcf of gas, even a fraction of a cent change adds up to real money.

No accounting entry made to the G/L.\n\nGas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.\n\nRecorded in December:\nDebit 858 3rd Party Transport exp\t\t14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000\n\tCredit A/P\t\t\t\t\t\t\t($42,000)\n\nProcedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.\n\nIf NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.\n\n\nCase B\t In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.\n\nNNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.\nNNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.\n\nRecorded in month of purchase on Transok's system:\nDebit 858 3rd Party Transport exp\t\t14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000\n\tCredit A/P\t\t\t\t\t\t\t($42,000)\n\nIn both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement). \n\n","content":"\n\tI have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.

Basically the question is whether the Carlton flow obligation is only the Tariff stated volume (ie., no fuel imputed) and that the remainder of the MDQ plus fuel on the whole 35,000/d will flow as primary firm receipts at Marshall.

All of the fuel for the\ntransport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has\n2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is\nmade, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at\nCarlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.

Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  \n\nReyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMedeles, Gerry  \nSent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 2:31 PM\nTo:\tWinckowski, Michele; Bodnar, Michael; Blair, Lynn\nCc:\tCabrera, Reyna\nSubject:\tRE: SBA Contracts\n\nI am not sure I understand the question.

We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.

The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc.  Again it should have remote capabilities. \n\nI would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers.  \n\nAlma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.

By far the biggest cost to me is the way we\nhave changed or nominations of natural gas from are suppliers as the\nspreadsheet will show. We made this change in the nomination for July,\nAugust & September. In calculating our nomination we look at what we could\nput firm into storage, plant usage on none run days and SMS if available. If\nthis was fixed back in June when we asked what was going on with storage and\nover runs into storage. I would have order large volumes of the Tier I\ninstead of purchasing the more costly Tier II.

By far the biggest cost to me is the way we\nhave changed or nominations of natural gas from are suppliers as the\nspreadsheet will show. We made this change in the nomination for July,\nAugust & September. In calculating our nomination we look at what we could\nput firm into storage, plant usage on none run days and SMS if available. If\nthis was fixed back in June when we asked what was going on with storage and\nover runs into storage. I would have order large volumes of the Tier I\ninstead of purchasing the more costly Tier II.

If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes  to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. \nGary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. \n \nQuestion:  Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season?\n \nChange from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity\nThe decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. \n\nSend \"Notice\" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity\nThe IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter.\n","content":"\nThe following summarizes the results of our meeting......If you want to discuss further, please call me.\n\nBreak Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point\nThe decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point.

I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. \nGary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. \n \nQuestion:  Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season?\n \nChange from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity\nThe decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. \n\nSend \"Notice\" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity\nThe IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter.\n","messageId":"<5117440.1075853079863.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-09-20T21:24:53+02:00","from":"michael.bodnar@enron.com","subject":"Results of Meeting on Storage Allocation Changes","cc":"doug.aschwege@enron.com, l..johnson@enron.com, jill.setera@enron.com","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","bcc":"doug.aschwege@enron.com, l..johnson@enron.com, jill.setera@enron.com","xFrom":"Bodnar, Michael </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBODNAR>","xTo":"Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>, Neville, Sue </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Snevill1>, January, Steven </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sjanuary>, Buchanan, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jbuchan2>, Medeles, Gerry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gmedele>, Kowalke, Terry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tkowalk>, Spraggins, Gary </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gspragg>, Holmes, Bradley </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bholmes>, Hoang, Joe </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhoang>, Swett, Larry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lswett>, Thomas, Steve </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sthomas1>, Miller, Kent </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kmiller2>, Threet, Kay </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kthreet>, Cabrera, Reyna </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rcabrer>, Branney, Theresa </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tbranne>, Roobaert, Preston </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Proobaer>","xCc":"Aschwege, Doug </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Daschwe>, Johnson, Robert L. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rjohnso3>, Setera, Jill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jsetera>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"lynn.blair@enron.com,sue.neville@enron.com,steven.january@enron.com,john.buchanan@enron.com,gerry.medeles@enron.com,terry.kowalke@enron.com,gary.spraggins@enron.com,bradley.holmes@enron.com,joe.hoang@enron.com,larry.swett@enron.com,steve.thomas@enron.com,kent.miller@enron.com,kay.threet@enron.com,reyna.cabrera@enron.com,theresa.branney@enron.com,preston.roobaert@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\nLaura,\nBased on the response received from Sue and TK (below), please remind PNM of the 10,000 Dth PNR balance and ask them to nominate the gas off TW at their earliest convenience.

Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future.\n \nsc\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  ","messageId":"<29005200.1075853080936.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-18T18:40:26+02:00","from":"scott.coburn@enron.com","subject":"Aberdeen and Welcome","cc":"ted.willimon@enron.com, mark.begley@enron.com, colin.strom@enron.com, ","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","bcc":"ted.willimon@enron.com, mark.begley@enron.com, colin.strom@enron.com, ","xFrom":"Coburn, Scott </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SCOBURN>","xTo":"Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>, Lagerstrom, Karen </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Klagers>","xCc":"Willimon, Ted </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Twillim>, Begley, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mbegley>, Strom, Colin </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cstrom>, Johnson, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rjohnso4>, Neppl, Ray </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rneppl>, Heckerman, Bambi </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bhecker>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"lynn.blair@enron.com,karen.lagerstrom@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\nSee Attached:\n\n \n\n\nJohn Buchanan\n\n","content":"\nSee Attached:\n\n \n\n\nJohn Buchanan\n\n","messageId":"<11623499.1075853080959.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-18T22:31:03+02:00","from":"john.buchanan@enron.com","subject":"Revised Timeline","cc":"lynn.blair@enron.com","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","bcc":"lynn.blair@enron.com","xFrom":"Buchanan, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JBUCHAN2>","xTo":"Garcia, Ava </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Agarcia6>","xCc":"Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"ava.garcia@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\n\nEarlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats.

He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.

Might have some mad shippers.\nHow will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???\nBecause the current methodology for allocation is based on a \"point\", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as \"SBA IT\"?\nThis is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?\n\nReyna Cabrera\n(713) 853-3072","messageId":"<4720649.1075853081519.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-26T20:07:13+02:00","from":"michael.bodnar@enron.com","subject":"RE: SBA Priority during Allocations","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Bodnar, Michael </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBODNAR>","xTo":"Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"lynn.blair@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\nThe Envision System will be down beginning Friday, October 26th at 5:00pm and will remain unavailable for use until Sunday, October 28th, 2001 at 8:00 am \nThis is being done to comply with the scheduled building power outage performed by TrizecHahn Office Properties. \nThe Three Allen Center Building, where the Envision equipment is located, has scheduled their annual building electrical shutdown on October 27, 2001. \nThe shutdown is required to perform preventive maintenance on the main switchgear and any necessary repairs to electrical panels, bus ducts, equipment, etc. \nAccess to the building will not be allowed during this power outage.\n\n\nEnvision/EnCompass Support Team\nDocument Mgmt and Process Automation\n713/853-1511 Opt 1\n\n ","content":"\nThe Envision System will be down beginning Friday, October 26th at 5:00pm and will remain unavailable for use until Sunday, October 28th, 2001 at 8:00 am \nThis is being done to comply with the scheduled building power outage performed by TrizecHahn Office Properties. \nThe Three Allen Center Building, where the Envision equipment is located, has scheduled their annual building electrical shutdown on October 27, 2001. \nThe shutdown is required to perform preventive maintenance on the main switchgear and any necessary repairs to electrical panels, bus ducts, equipment, etc. \nAccess to the building will not be allowed during this power outage.\n\n\nEnvision/EnCompass Support Team\nDocument Mgmt and Process Automation\n713/853-1511 Opt 1\n\n ","messageId":"<17286025.1075853081544.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-26T20:59:39+02:00","from":"sylvia.thomas@enron.com","subject":"FILENET SYSTEM OUTAGE","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","xFrom":"Thomas, Sylvia </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=STHOMA2>","xTo":"Thomas, Sylvia </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sthoma2>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"sylvia.thomas@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\nAs discussed in our morning meeting the other day, NNG has a few points that have been approved as points that could potentially have daily capacity (capacity available for some time frame less than 30 days) throughout this winter.

The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.\n\nThanks,\n\nRaetta\n\n\n\n << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> \nTeam Farmington-Pipeline\n06/14/2001 03:04 PM\nTo:\tTom Rice/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bob Stevens/ET&S/Enron, Raetta Zadow/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Angeline Stewart/GPGFIN/Enron, Diana Porter/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\ncc:\t \n\nSubject:\tDaily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas\n\nI recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","messageId":"<13444725.1075853081976.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"2001-10-29T14:09:52+01:00","from":"tom.rice@enron.com","subject":"RE: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas","cc":"lynn.blair@enron.com, rick.dietz@enron.com, jodie.floyd@enron.com, ","mimeVersion":"1.0","contentType":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","contentTransferEncoding":"7bit","bcc":"lynn.blair@enron.com, rick.dietz@enron.com, jodie.floyd@enron.com, ","xFrom":"Rice, Tom </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TRICE4>","xTo":"Anderson, Gary E. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ganders>, Zadow, Raetta </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rzadow>, Lachapelle, Donna </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dlachap>, Stewart, Angeline </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Astewar>, Farmington-Pipeline, Team </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=4b6664ca-5b37e9fb-86256774-712b65>","xCc":"Blair, Lynn </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lblair>, Dietz, Rick </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rdietz>, Floyd, Jodie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jfloyd>, Craddock, Larry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lcraddo>","xFolder":"\\LBLAIR (Non-Privileged)\\Blair, Lynn\\Inbox","xOrigin":"Blair-L","xFileName":"LBLAIR (Non-Privileged).pst","to":"e..anderson@enron.com,raetta.zadow@enron.com,donna.lachapelle@enron.com,angeline.stewart@enron.com,team.farmington-pipeline@enron.com"},{"rawContent":"\nAll Reps, please check with all our customers and make sure that they can retrieve and print the scheduled quantities report.
