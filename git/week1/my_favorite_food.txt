Acorn Squash with Orange Marmalade is a quick, easy vegetable side dish that has great appeal due to its slight sweetness.

Ingredients
1 medium acorn squash, halved lengthwise
1 tablespoon orange marmalade
1 teaspoon butter or margarine
1/8 teaspoon salt
Procedure
Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).
Remove seeds and strings from squash halves.
Cut a small piece off outside of each half to make a flat space on which the half can stand level.
Place halves in a shallow pan or casserole in 1/4 inch (6 mm) water with insides facing down. Bake for 35 minutes.
Combine marmalade and butter in a small bowl.
Remove squash from oven, invert in pan or dish. Salt lightly.
Spread marmalade and butter mixture on edges of squash, allowing excess to run into center.
Place under broiler for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.
